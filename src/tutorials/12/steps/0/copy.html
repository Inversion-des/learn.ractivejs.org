<p>Normally, when an element is rendered, it just sort of gets plonked on the page. With Ractive you have more control: you can specify <code>intro</code> transitions:</p>

<pre class='prettypring lang-html'>
&lt;div intro='fade'&gt;
  This div will fade into view
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>Try adding intros to the three buttons in the template, choosing from <code>fade</code>, <code>slide</code> and <code>fly</code>, which have been included on this page.</p>

<aside>
	<p>As with custom events, transitions are distributed as plugins, <a href='http://docs.ractivejs.org/latest/plugins'>which you can download here</a> to use in your project. You can create your own transitions &ndash; <a href='http://docs.ractivejs.org/latest/writing-transition-plugins'>see this docs page</a> for more info.</p>

	<p>Where possible, Ractive uses CSS transitions, but in older browsers it will fall back to timer-based animation.</p>
