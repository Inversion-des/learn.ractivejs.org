<p>Similarly, we can specify <code>outro</code> transitions. When an element is no longer needed on the page, it will exit gracefully.</p>

<p>Try adding <code>outro</code> transitions to the three buttons;</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-html'>
&lt;button intro='fade' outro='fly' on-tap='show:2'&gt;
  Click me!
&lt;/button&gt;
</pre>

<p>Execute the code. Aaargh! It looks horrible!</p>

<p>That's because new elements are being rendered before the old ones get removed from the DOM. What we need to do is <em>chain</em> the transitions &ndash; trigger the removal, wait, and then trigger rendering of the new element.</p>

<p>Calling <code>ractive.set()</code> returns a <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise'>Promise</a>, which resolves on completion of any transitions that are caused by the change. So you can do this:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-js'>
ractive.on({
  show: function ( event, which ) {
    ractive.set( 'visible', null ).then( function () {
      ractive.set( 'visible', which );
    });
  }
});
</pre>

<aside>
	<p>Several methods return a promise, not just <code>ractive.set()</code> &ndash; <code>ractive.update()</code>, <code>ractive.teardown()</code>, <code>ractive.render()</code>, and all of the array methods such as <code>ractive.push()</code>.</p>

	<p>Because not all browsers implement promises, Ractive currently ships its own <a href='http://promisesaplus.com/'>spec-compliant</a> implementation, but will use native promises wherever possible. Whichever implementation it uses is exposed as <code>Ractive.Promise</code>.</p>
