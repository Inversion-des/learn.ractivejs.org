<p>Welcome to Learn Ractive.js. This is a set of interactive tutorials which you can take at your own pace. Each tutorial consists of a number of steps &ndash; you're currently on step 1 of the 'Hello world!' tutorial.</p>

<p>At any time you can reset the current step by clicking the <strong>Reset</strong> button above.</p>

<h3>Let's get started</h3>

<p>Try creating a new Ractive by executing the JavaScript in the bottom right box by hitting <kbd>Shift-Enter</kbd> (or tapping the <strong>Execute</strong> button).</p>

<aside>
	<p>In later steps, if you can't get it to work (or if you're just lazy!) you can click the <strong>Fix code</strong> button below to insert working code as though you'd followed the instructions exactly. For now, it's disabled.</p>

	<p>Throughout the tutorials, boxes like this will contain technical notes and asides, for the particularly nerdy or curious.</p>
