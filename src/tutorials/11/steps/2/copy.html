<p>Ractive can potentially be used to turn static illustrations into interactive pieces, like this neuron cell diagram, based on the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Complete_neuron_cell_diagram_en.svg'>original from Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<div class='hint'>
	<p>This is a complex graphic &ndash; some browsers (Firefox, I'm looking at you) may struggle. This is just because they're not as good at rendering SVG as other browsers, not because of anything <span class='logo'>Ractive.js</span> is doing.</p>
</div>

<p>In this case, the diagram was modified using Adobe Illustrator (to separate the closeups into their own groups, and add text-based labels rather than path-based ones), then hand-edited to add the interactivity.</p>

<p>Right now, it's a laborious process, as Illustrator and <a href='http://inkscape.org/'>Inkscape</a> create SVG that can be difficult to edit by hand. But it's totally possible.</p>

<div class='hint'>
	<p>You'll probably want to make the <strong>#output</strong> block larger &ndash; drag its uppermost and rightmost borders.</p>
