<p>That's all well and good, but it's a little on the verbose side. You can imagine if we had lots more properties on the capital city object that we wanted to refer to &ndash; we don't want to keep writing <code>{{country.capital.xyz}}</code> if we don't have to.</p>

<p>We don't have to. Instead, we can use a <em>with section</em> to provide <em>context</em>:</p>

<pre class='prettyprint lang-html'>
{{#with country}}
  &lt;p&gt;{{name}} is a {{climate.temperature}} country
  with {{climate.rainfall}} rainfall and a population
  of {{population}}.&lt;/p&gt;
{{/with}}
</pre>

<aside>
	<p>Strictly speaking, you don't need the <code>with</code> - you can just use a <code>#</code> sign by itself:</p>

	<pre class='prettyprint lang-html'</pre>{{#country}}
  &lt;p&gt;{{name}} is a {{climate.temperature}} country
  with {{climate.rainfall}} rainfall and a population
  of {{population}}.&lt;/p&gt;
{{/country}}</pre>

	<p>In this case, when Ractive looks up <code>country</code>, it will decide whether to render a <code>with</code>, <code>if</code> or <code>each</code> section based on its value. We'll learn about <code>if</code> and <code>each</code> shortly.</p>

	<p>Generally, it's better to be explicit about which type of section you intend &ndash; other programmers (including future you) will be grateful.</p>
</aside>

<p>Go ahead and update the template, creating a section for the capital as well. (You can either create a <code>{{#with country.capital}}</code> section, or a <code>{{#with capital}}</code> section <em>inside</em> the <code>{{#with country}}</code> section. Use whichever structure is easier in a given situation.)</p>

<aside>
	<p>Notice that if you create a <code>{{#with capital}}</code> section, you could end up having two <code>{{name}}</code> variables &ndash; one for the country, one for the capital.<p>

	<p>We say that the capital <code>{{name}}</code> reference has a two-level <em>context stack</em> &ndash; if the innermost context (<code>country.capital</code>) has a <code>name</code> property, <code>{{name}}</code> resolves to the <code>country.capital.name</code> <em>keypath</em>.</p>

	<p>If not, Ractive moves <em>up the context stack</em> (in this case, to <code>country</code>, and then to the root <code>data</code> object) until it <em>does</em> find a context with a <code>name</code> property. Once a reference is resolved, its keypath is fixed. Unresolved references are re-evaluated with each call to <code>ractive.set()</code>.</p>
